➢ Designed and conducted the data experiments of denoising low-field MRI brain images with self-supervised networks 
and achieved distinct and adjustable denoising effects.
➢ Realized the neural network MU-Net based on Tensorflow and adopted pairwise averaging tricks to alleviate blurring 
during denoising iterations.
➢ Demonstrated that the SNR bottleneck of the low-field MRI can be overcome using self-supervised denoising networks.
